I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.unlv.edu/cs/) at the [University of Nevada-Las Vegas](https://www.unlv.edu/) (UNLV).
I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Wei Li](https://tinman.cs.gsu.edu/~wli28/) and [Dr. Zhipeng Cai](http://cai.csgsu.org/index.html).
Prior to my doctoral study, I received my M.E. degree and B.S. degree from Department of Computer Science, Harbin Engineering University in 2019 and Department of Mathematics, Northeast Forestry University in 2016, respectively.
My research has been recognized through publications in leading conferences and journals, including
